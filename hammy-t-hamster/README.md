# The Ultimate Smart Assistant (WIP)

This is a weekend project to bring life to the two animatronic hamsters living on my desk.

*With Hammy T. Hamster, you too will never forget to take your glasses off at the end of the day again!*

## Components
- Raspberry Pi 3b
- Mini 3.5 Jack speaker
- [Spooky Jazz Hamster](https://gemmy.fandom.com/wiki/Spooky_(Hamster))
- [Jailhouse Rick Hamster](https://gemmy.fandom.com/wiki/Jailhouse_Rick_(Hamster)) (criminal record optional)
- 5v Relay
- Too much free time

## Usage

Easily controlled with a series of cron jobs, or via command line
```bash
# Swears at you
/usr/sbin/hammy lunch
```

## Future
I'd like this to be entirely MQTT controlled on a pico W.
